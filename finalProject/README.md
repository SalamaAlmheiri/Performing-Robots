# Final Project (working with Amina)

## Robot Design - Happy and Bashful by Salama and Amina

### Components:
**1 servo motor**
- To move the arm that will have a removable axe attached to it.
- The servo motor will move up and down continuously while pulling the string that is attached to the cardboard flap which will make the “hand” movement for the axe.

**4 DC motors**
- Controlled by the buttons

**1 neopixel**
- Displaying the characters emotion
- Changes from happy to bashful.
- Happy: :D (yellow)
- Bashful: UwU (red)

### Additional decoration
- Dwarf hat
- White beard
- Hammer or other tools for the mine
- Belt

### Scenes
**Scene 2 (inside the mine)**
- Neopixel= happy
- Using the buttons to move our robot (DC)
- Pressing a button to make the robot move the axe (servo)

**Scene 3 (meeting snow white)**
- Enter house: Moving the robot with the buttons again (awkward movements for bashful)
- Neopixel= bashful
- Robots leaving: use buttons to move.

**Scene 5 (find snow white asleep)**

**Aminas Idea:**
- The robot will be both happy and bashful but in different scenes it will change.
- In the mine it will be happy
- Meeting Snow White will be bashful (making the red face with neopixel and awkward moves with DC motors).
- In the final scene, the robot becomes more comfortable with Snow White and turns back to “happy”
