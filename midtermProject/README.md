# Midterm Project Performing Robot 
## Concept:
### Robot Name: Squiggle

- My idea for this project was to create a robot that is able to draw. The robot's name is **Squiggle**, because it creates squiggles as it draws!
- As an artistic person I love drawing and painting. I also love seeing others draw so I decided, why not create a robot that can draw and it would be entertaining to watch. The viewer could also interact with the robot as they can choose between 2 buttons to decide between choosing the colors Green or Red.
- **(Intended) Expressions:** happy and excited! Or whatever you want to perceive it as!

**Inspiration:**
- I was alo inspired by [Harold Cohen's](https://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/delving-into-coding-the-art-of-harold-cohen-aaron-computer-generated) program called [Aaron](http://aaronshome.com/aaron/index.html), which autonomously created abstract drawings and I really loved the artwork and the idea. My robot is definitely not as complicated as what he has created but it was inspired by the idea of 'Robot Art'.

**Paper 'artwork':**  
- I love how the paper turned and and I was not expecting it to look like this. You can see the movement of the robot. This was created after many tries of testing and moving the robot.

**Process:**
- Detailed process can be seen in my [Journal!]()
- The process was definitely challenging and I came across a lot of **problems:**
1) I built the whole robot with cardboard and attatched all the components I was going to use but when I attatched the wheels and tried to test it, the robot would not stay balanced. I tried attatching a little cardboard piece at the bottom but that affected the wheels when turning. I also built a whole new robot which was exactly the same but much smaller but it still had the same problem so I decided not to use it. So the **solution** that I came up with was adding a bottle cap with a whole in it and placing a marble that would roll and allow the robot to move!
3) The 9v batteries were also a problem. I used 5 batteries in total!! As the voltage decreased from the use of testing the robot, the wheels started moving slower and sometimes not working at all which affected my code and sequence that I created. So I kept having to change them every once in a while.
4) The receiver radio module suddenly stopped working when I came back to test out the robot with the radio code. I thought there was a problem with the wires of the code but when I changed the radio it thankfully worked!
5) Since the robot moves in a sequence that I created, a lot of the time it would not go where I want it to but that is something that is expected and it created an amazing 'artwork'! (But the consequence is that half of my floor is now covered with green and red lines lol!)

**Changes:**
- In my initial design I intended to add a neopixel and some LED's but that would have over complicated the process and the other problem took a lot of my time to figure out so I decided not to add them and that still did not change the purpose of my robot!

**Components used:** 
- 2 DC Motors
- 2 Servo Motors
- 2 Radio modules
- 2 Push Buttons
