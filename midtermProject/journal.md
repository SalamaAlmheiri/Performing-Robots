# Midterm Project documentation

### October 2

Idea:
- My idea for this project is to create a robot that is able to draw with a viewers response after pressing a button.
- I am still not sure as to how this will be done but I am thinking of adding 2 buttons that the viewer can interact with the robot. Different buttons will have different responses and the drawing would look different.
- **Actuators** that will be used: 2 DC motors, 2 Servo motors, Neopixel matrix, (maybe an LED).

Initial Design:

Process 1:
- I built the initial structure of the robot (it looks like a house from the inside)
- I tried my best to make it more organized so that I can easily adjust the wires and other things.
- I added the 2 DC motors, 2 Servo motors (which will act as the hands to hold the pen),and the 9v battery to make it wireless.
- Next step would be to start working on the code (and also maybe adding the neopixel matrix or the LED).
