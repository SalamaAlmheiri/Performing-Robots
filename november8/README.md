## 1. Reading Response: *On Stage: Robots as Performers*
- I watched a performance [video](https://youtu.be/l9OUbqWHOSk) of the robot *Shimon* that is mentioned in the paper. The performance is really fascinating! The way the robot is nodding with the music is very expressive and makes it enjoyable to watch. It is also very cool to see a human-robot performance especially a mucical one. I like the way the human musicians and the robot both seem to be communicating with each other through music and trying to match each other.

Questions:
- The concepts mentioned in the reading like "inner monologue" is something that a human actor would do, so why would it be better to apply this on robot actors?
- Why is it important to include humans in robot performances?

## 2. Robot Play Idea:
Consider why a robot should perform in this role. Some suggestions:
Can robots be used to explore topics that are too difficult for humans (e.g. difficult conversations)?
Can robots be used to explore human-robot coexistence ?

- For the robot play idea, I would like to use and improve my idea that I proposed from my last [assignment](https://github.com/SalamaAlmheiri/Performing-Robots/tree/main/october25#readme) which was based on the *Wizard of Oz* play. 
- The scene that I chose is was when Dorothy meets the tinman. 
- The robot that we will build will be the tinman (with the same describtion from my last assignment). I chose this character because the character is supposed to be a "tin can" but is actually played by a real person in the play. So it would suite the character to be played by a robot. And the character's movements can be easily replicated with a robot.
- In the scene, Dorothy has her dog with her. In the play they actually brought a real dog to perform as Dorothy's dog, so I was thinking that It would be interesting to replace it with one of Boston Dynamics dog, Spot.
