## 1. Reading Response: *On Stage: Robots as Performers*
- I watched a performance [video](https://youtu.be/l9OUbqWHOSk) of the robot *Shimon* that is mentioned in the paper. The performance is really fascinating! The way the robot is nodding with the music is very expressive and makes it enjoyable to watch. It is also very cool to see a human-robot performance especially a mucical one. I like the way the human musicians and the robot both seem to be communicating with each other through music and trying to match each other.

Questions:
- The concepts mentioned in the reading like "inner monologue" is something that a human actor would do, so why would it be better to apply this on robot actors?
- Why is it important to include humans in robot performances?

## 2. Robot Play Idea:
Consider why a robot should perform in this role. Some suggestions:
Can robots be used to explore topics that are too difficult for humans (e.g. difficult conversations)?
Can robots be used to explore human-robot coexistence ?
