# Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Play
In one scene of the movie, the dwarfs are working in a mine. Sleepy transports the diamonds, Doc determines their value and Dopey throw away the rejected ones. Happy, Grumpy, Sneezy and Bashful are the diggers.

### Scene for our Play:
**Happy, Grumpy, Sneezy and Bashful:**
- 4 robots that will have a motion of "digging" the mines for diamonds.
- The digging motion can be achieved using the servo motors attatched with an object that looks like an axe. It will have a repeating motion of hitting the "rock" area and pulling back.
- Flashing LED's will be used around them to represent the shinning diamonds.
- **Sound:** Sound of digging: the axe hitting the rocks.

**Sleepy:**
- Could be a character that is sitting on a cart that would be the robot with 4 wheels.
- The cart be containing or "transporting" diamonds. Sleepy will be sitting on the cart, 
- **Sound:** maybe making sleepy "zzz" noises to show his personality.
- Wheels (movement) controlled by the buttons

**Doc:**
- (Not sure how we can make a robot determine the value of the diamonds, or look/ examine the diamonds)

**Dopey:**
- Is sweeping the rest of the unwanted diamonds
- This could be done by attatching something at the bottom of the robot so when it moves towards the diamonds, it moves them to a certain area to dispose them. (The movement can be controlled using the buttons).

### All Together:
- So the play will have 4 areas/ scenes which will occur one after the other:
1. 4 dwarf robots digging the mine.
2. Sleepy transporting diamonds in the cart.
3. Doc examining the diamonds.
4. Dopey sweeping/ throwing them away.

**Background music:**
- The original music played in the scene + the sound effects for each scene.



# Response to Chp. 6 "The ‘Other’ Actor" by to Nadja Masura

It is unfortunate that I could not find any recorded videos of the plays and performances mentioned in the paper because it would have been more interesting to experience the performance (even from online) and to understand it better. 
I researched a little bit more about the "Blue Bloodshot Flowers" performance because I found it interesting because it demonstrates a human and nonhuman interaction. The performance combines an AI called Jeremiah which is a computer program, a face that can see the human actor and can react to show emotions. When I saw pictures of it, I did think about the "uncanny valley" feeling because the face of the AI is kind-of unsettling. I wish I can see the performance to understand it better, but from the pictures I still wonder how and why did the creators design the face like this?
