# Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Play
In one scene of the movie, the dwarfs are working in a mine. Sleepy transports the diamonds, Doc determines their value and Dopey throw away the rejected ones. Happy, Grumpy, Sneezy and Bashful are the diggers.

### Scene for the Play:
**Happy, Grumpy, Sneezy and Bashful:**
- 4 robots that will have a motion of "digging" the mines for diamonds.
- The digging motion can be achieved using the servo motors attatched with an object that looks like an axe. It will have a repeating motion of hitting the "rock" area and pulling back.
- Flashing LED's will be used around them to represent the shinning diamonds.
- **Sound:** Sound of digging: the axe hitting the rocks.

**Sleepy:**
- Could be a character that is sitting on a cart that would be the robot with 4 wheels.
- The cart be containing or "transporting" diamonds. Sleepy will be sitting on the cart, 
- **Sound:** maybe making sleepy "zzz" noises to show his personality.
- Wheels (movement) controlled by the buttons

**Doc:**
- (Not sure how we can make a robot determine the value of the diamonds, or look/ examine the diamonds)

**Dopey:**
- Is sweeping the rest of the unwanted diamonds
- This could be done by attatching something at the bottom of the robot so when it moves towards the diamonds, it moves them to a certain area to dispose them. (The movement can be controlled using the buttons).

### All Together:
- So the play will have 4 areas/ scenes which will occur one after the other:
1. 4 dwarf robots digging the mine.
2. Sleepy transporting diamonds in the cart.
3. Doc examining the diamonds.
4. Dopey sweeping/ throwing them away.

**Background music:**
- The original music played in the scene + the sound effects for each scene.
