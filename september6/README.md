## Autonomous Robots as Performing Agents
**By Karl R. Wurst and Robert McCartney**

This reading is very interesting but quite hard to comprehend at first because the paper is about preforming and it explains the ideas of how agents would preform, so I would prefer to look at the performance of the robots to better understand it because I am more of a visual person. I also noticed the figures which were helpful at providing an idea to what a "woggle" looks like. Also, as I continued to read, the topic became more interesting becasue this is the first time i have read about a topic like this and I wanted to understand more about how robots could be used as performing agents.

I have once done research on Boston Dynamics' Automated dog robot called "Spot". It performs a lot of tasks including dancing. I found it very interesting and amusing. They also have other robots for specific tasks however it is interesting that most of them have been built to also be able to "perform" or dance. 

Questions:
- Do people prefer Robotic preformance over human performance?
