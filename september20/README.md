# DC Motor Robot Production Assignment:


**My definition of "Robot":** 
- Something created by people that looks humanoid and is able to replicate human movement.


**Story:** 
- This robot does not have a specific story since I was still trying to figure things out by building it. But I wanted to create something that resembels what I imagine a robot would looks like, something that has a square body and eyes on its head. The sequence idea was to make the robot do a parking motion.

**Process:**
- The base of the robot includes the curcuit (HBridge, 2 motors, arduino, battery) which I covered with cardboard. I placed the robot on top of the cardboard that coveres the base. Therefore the robot design could be changed without having to break or remove the base.
- I used 2 motors to make the robot move.
- The sequence resembels a parking motion. The robot moves forward, then backwards, right, backwards again, left then stops.
- I did face a few problems while building the circuit for the robot. The most difficult part was figuring out how to make it move in the direction I want it to move. Trying to figure out the correct movements was hard because sometimes one motor does not work.
- I was trying to use the pwn pins to use analoguewrite to control the speed but choosing the value was difficult as every motor has different value so I had to play around with it to know which works.
