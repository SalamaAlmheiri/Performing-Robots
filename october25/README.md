**About The Wizard of Oz:**
- It was a 1902 musical extravaganza based on the 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum.
- I Remember watching the movie when I was younger and being fascinated by the characters and story so I decided to base this assignment on the musical play of which is based on the story.

Short Synopsis:
- Dorothy, her dog and the farmhouse were suddenly swept away by a tornado, taken to the magical Land of Oz where she meets a good witch that gives her the rubby slippers and tells her to never take it off. She then goes on a journey to find a way to return home where she meets characters who follow her and were also seeking something. The Scarecrow was wishing for a brain, the lion was seeking courage and the Tin man wishing for a heart. Dorothy comes across a lot of obstacles and different events happen but they overcome them because of the Scarecrow’s good sense, the bravery of the Cowardly Lion and the Tin man’s kindness. In the end, it is revealed that Dorothy can return home by simply closing her eyes, clicking the heels of the slippers together three times and repeating the phrase, "There's no place like home."
- The scene that I chose is where Dorothy meets the Tin man.
- The Tin man was seeking a heart which is contradicting that I am making a robot perform a scene of a character that wants a heart, even though it is obvious that a robot cannot have a heart and the same goes for the character which is a object "tin".

Robot Actor:

- To create the robot, the body will be an actual tin to emphasise on the design and name of the character.


Choose a short scene from a play and a character in that scene, and consider how you would make a robot actor to perform that scene. Any spoken words will come from a human or a computer, not from your actor.   
How would you build the actor?    
What technical features will the actor need?    
How will you construct the actor to create the role?    
How will you decorate or dress the actor for best effect?    
What sequence of moves or other actions will you give your actor so that they can best play the part?
