**About The Wizard of Oz:**
- It was a 1902 musical extravaganza based on the 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum.
- I Remember watching the movie when I was younger and being fascinated by the characters and story so I decided to base this assignment on the musical play of which is based on the story.


Short Synopsis:  
- Dorothy, her dog and the farmhouse were suddenly swept away by a tornado, taken to the magical Land of Oz where she meets a good witch that gives her the rubby slippers and tells her to never take it off. She then goes on a journey to find a way to return home where she meets characters who follow her and were also seeking something. The Scarecrow was wishing for a brain, the lion was seeking courage and the Tin man wishing for a heart. Dorothy comes across a lot of obstacles and different events happen but they overcome them because of the Scarecrow’s good sense, the bravery of the Cowardly Lion and the Tin man’s kindness. In the end, it is revealed that Dorothy can return home by simply closing her eyes, clicking the heels of the slippers together three times and repeating the phrase, "There's no place like home."

Scene:  
- [Example Play](https://youtu.be/k3B1GCpxzyk?t=2861) The scene starts at 47:40.
- The scene that I chose is when Dorothy meets the Tin man. She finds him rusted in the forest unable to move and helps him by using an oil can to release him. 
- Also, the fact that the Tin man was seeking a heart which is contradicting to the idea that a robot would perform a scene of a character that wants a heart, even though it is obvious that a robot cannot have a heart and the same goes for the character which is a object "tin".

Robot Actor:
- To create the robot, the body will be an actual tin to emphasise on the design and name of the character.
- DC motors will be used for "leg" movement.
- As well as Servo motors for hand movements.
- Light sensor.
- The scene of oiling the rusted tin is what I want the robot to perform. So at the start the actor will not be moving but when an oil can is brought near it, it will slowly start to make small movements in its arms and "legs" (motors) until it is able to move normally.
- I think that the "robotic" movement of the motors will be a good way to replicate the movement of the Tin man in the play as it actually moves in an unatural way and its design is somehow similair to what we think of when we used to imagine a robot would look like (something made out of metal and has "robotic" movements).
